The project consist of a giphy search and displays a collapsing navbar.

To use the site is simple. Type in anything in the search bar and a gif will appear on the site. 

Html, css, and javascript were used

For the future I would add a more interactive search bar. Add more content to the site. Have a better layout for the gifs when displayed.

As a user I want to be able to view the site on the phone so I can look up gifs on the go
